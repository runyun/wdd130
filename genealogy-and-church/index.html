                In God’s plan, we can be with God and also our family forever, which means not only in this life but the life after death.
                 So, it is meaningful to find our deceased ancestors and help them to do ordinances that God requests for each of his children.
                 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints performs these ordinances just like the ancient time mentioned in the Bible (1 Corinthians 15:19).
