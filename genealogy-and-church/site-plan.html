        Family is the most important part of people’s life. No matter it is good or bad, we are all influenced by our family members in some way.
        “We are part of a divine plan designed by Heavenly Parents who love us.” M. Russell Ballard.
        In God’s plan, we can be with God and also our family forever, which means not only in this life but the life after death. 
        So, it is meaningful to find our deceased ancestors and help them to do ordinances that God requests for each of his children. 
        The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints performs these ordinances just like the ancient time mentioned in the Bible (1 Corinthians 15:19).

      <h3>FamilySearch</h3>
      <p>
        FamilySearch is a free website that has “the world’s largest family tree and genealogy archive. (FamilySearch website)”
        On this website, people would have a chance to connect to each other’s family tree and also know our ancestors through records such as documents, stories, photos, and sound recordings.
        It is important to develop love with family members. We can do it by trying to know them more deeply.

      <h3>Temple</h3>
      <p>
        In the temple, we can do ordinances that help people who pass away. The purpose of these ordinances is to help people return to God’s presence and be with family after life through God’s power.
        Those people who pass away without the knowledge of God will have a chance to be taught after their death. We can help our ancestors to do the ordinances which include baptisms and others ordinances in the temple. 
        Our ancestors can decide whether to receive these offers or not.
